# System Design

In this page, we'll discuss about how our app uses some technologies and algorithms together in order to meet functional & non-functional requirements.

### Assumptions

Total registered users: 2.500 users. Total daily users: 100 users. Size for one user: ~224 Bytes.

1. id (uses UUID): 16 bytes
2. username (max 50 characters): max 50 bytes
3. password (uses Argon2): 150 Bytes
4. created_at (uses Datetime): 8 bytes

Total size for all users: ~560 KBytes

```
224 Bytes x 2.500 users
= 560.000 Bytes
= 560 KBytes
```

Size for one note: ~374 Bytes

```
1. id (uses UUID): 16 bytes
2. title (max 100 characters): max 100 bytes
3. subtitle (max 200 characters): max 200 bytes
4. author_name (links to user's username): max 50 bytes
5. created_at (uses Datetime): 8 bytes
```

Average notes for non-daily users: 1 note. Average notes for daily users: 5 notes

Total notes: ~2.900 notes

```
1. non-daily users:
      = 1 note x (2.500 total users - 100 daily users)
      = 1 note x (2.400 non-daily users)
      = 2.400 notes (owned by non-daily users)
2. daily users:
      = 5 notes x 100 daily users
      = 500 notes (owned by daily users)
```

Total size for all notes: ~1,0846 MBytes

```
374 Bytes x 2.900 notes
= 1.084.600 Bytes
= 1,0846 MBytes
```

### Conclusions

Total size for all data: ~1,6446 MBytes

```
all notes data + all users data
= 1,0846 MBytes + 560 KBytes
= 1,0846 MBytes + 0,56 MBytes
= 1,6446 MBytes
```
