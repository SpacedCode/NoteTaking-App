# Functional Requirements

Functional Requirements need to be defined early in the design process so that the collaborating team can more easily determine development milestones. According to [GeeksforGeeks](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/software-engineering/functional-vs-non-functional-requirements/), a Functional Requirement is defined as the specific features and operations of a system that must be present to meet business and user needs.

For the purposes of this discussion, here is a list of Functional Requirements that can be summarized:

## 1. Authentication & Authorization

The application must provide a login mechanism. We can utilize Google OAuth for this.

## 2. Class Data Integration

The application must be able to read data from the user's Google Classroom, such as a list of classes they are enrolled in, class names, and the user's role in those classes.

## 3. Automatic Class Creation

This feature will be active when a user with the teacher role has integrated their account with the application, allowing the system to retrieve data from their account and create a class instance.

Only then can users with the student role join a teacher-initiated class. So here, a mechanism needs to be created where classes where students have entered but teachers have not yet been integrated will make the application provide appropriate feedback (perhaps a kind of message to contact the relevant teacher).
