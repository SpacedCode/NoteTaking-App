# Non-Functional Requirements

Non-functional requirements are just as important as functional requirements. Defining them early can help the team make technical decisions, such as performance and the technology used.

As far as the discussion is concerned, here are the non-functional requirements that can be summarized.

## 1. Security

Applications must carefully consider the use of user credentials. Plans for using Google OAuth require careful consideration of its requirements to ensure more secure credential transactions. Token procurement must be stored appropriately. The system must not store sensitive user data without explicit permission. All API communications must be secure.

## 2. Privacy & Compliance

The system must only access data authorized by the user through Google OAuth scopes and must comply with API policies. User data must be purged upon user request.

## 3. Performance

Data fetching must complete in less than 3 seconds on a normal connection. Class synchronization must be efficient and not overload the server. API call limitations must be considered.

## 4. Reliability & Availability

The system must remain functional even if the Google Classroom API is slow or experiencing errors. A suitable approach is to display a fallback message rather than crash the application. The system should have a lightweight retry function for failed requests, or, more importantly, a fallback message.

## 5. Scalability

User growth must be anticipated, including concurrency from active users. Multiple classes per user and multiple members per class also require further review. The database structure must adequately support community growth.

## 6. Maintainability

Feature and API integration must be modular for easy maintainability. A logging mechanism should be in place for debugging and system monitoring.

## 7. Usability

The login process should be simple, and the UI should clearly display status (loading, success, and error).

## 8. Compatibility

The application must function smoothly on the user's device and be compatible with all APIs and third-party libraries used.

## 9. Data Integrity

Data retrieved from Google must be consistent and free of duplication. The system must maintain the connection between users and Google Classroom.
